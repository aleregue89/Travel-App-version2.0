# Travel-App-version2.0
Udacity Final Project - Front End Web Dev
author: Alejandro Regueira

Project Summary:
I've created a travel application, pulling basic data from 3 differents API's (Geonames, DarkSky & Pixabay). User will be able to input the city of destination providing the dates of departure and return. The app will handle the communications between these API's and retrive the Weather-Forecast and a picture of the destination's city or  country if in case the API doesn't have for that particular place. Other's features are a countdown timer showing the user how many days are left for the trip and providing the lenght of the trip.

This app was built using:
HTML & CSS - for Markup and styling.
Express - in order to create a server using NPM a node package manager. 
Webpack - as a module blunder.
JavaScript - as the main programming language.
